A sorted array of distinct elements arr[] is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the minimum element in the array.
Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here 1 is the minimum element.
Input: arr[] = [4, 2, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: Here 2 is the minimum element.



int findMin(vector<int>& arr) 
    {
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        int n = arr.size();
        int low = 0;
        int high = n-1;
        while(low <= high)
        {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            if(arr[low] <= arr[mid]) // left part is sorted
            {
                if(arr[low] < ans)
                    ans = arr[low];
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else  // right part is sorted
            {
                if(arr[mid] < ans)
                    ans = arr[mid];
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
