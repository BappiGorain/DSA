Given an array arr[] and an integer k where k is smaller than the size of the array, the task is to find the kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

Note:-  l and r denotes the starting and ending index of the array.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
arr[] = 7 10 4 3 20 15
k = 3
l=0 r=5

Output : 
7




 int kthSmallest(int arr[], int l, int r, int k) {
        //code here
        sort(arr+l,arr+r+1);
        return arr[l+k-1];
    
    }
