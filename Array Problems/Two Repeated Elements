You are given an integer n and an integer array arr of size n+2. All elements of the array are in the range from 1 to n. Also, all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.
Note: Return the numbers in their order of appearing twice. So, if x and y are repeating numbers, and x's second appearance comes before the second appearance of y, then the order should be (x, y).

Examples:

Input: n = 4, arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3]
Output: 1 3
Explanation: In the given array, 1 and 3 are repeated two times, and as 1's second appearance occurs before 2's second appearance, so the output should be 1 3.


vector<int> twoRepeated(int n, int arr[])
    {
        vector<int> ans;
        
         for(int i=0;i<n+2;i++)
         {
            if(arr[abs(arr[i])] > 0)
            {
                arr[abs(arr[i])] *= -1;
            }
            else
            {
                ans.push_back(abs(arr[i]));
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
