Given two integers a and b, the task is to find the sum of a and b without using + or â€“ operators.

Examples: 

Input: a = 10, b = 30
Output: 40


Input: a = -1, b = 2
Output: 1



int add(int a, int b)
{
    while(b != 0)
    {
        int carry = (a & b) >> 1;
        a = a ^ n;
        b = carry;
    }
  return a;
}
