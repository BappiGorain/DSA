Given a string s without spaces, a character ch and an integer count. Your task is to return the substring that remains after 
the character ch has appeared count number of times.
Note:  Assume upper case and lower case alphabets are different. “”(Empty string) should be returned if it is not possible, or the remaining substring is empty.

Examples:

Input: s = "Thisisdemostring", ch = 'i', count = 3
Output: ng
Explanation: The remaining substring of s after the 3rd
occurrence of 'i' is "ng", hence the output is ng.



string printString(string s, char ch, int count)
    {
        string str = "";
        int n = s.length();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(s[i] == ch)
            {
                count--;
            }
            if(count == 0)
            {
               return s.substr(i+1);
               
            }
        }
        return "";
    }
